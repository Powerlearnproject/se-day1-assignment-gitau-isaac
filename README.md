Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of modelling computer software that involves the design,development,testing,deployment and maintainance of software applications

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
start of structured programing-this was introduces as a development methode to improve clarity and quality. it emphasised the use of control structres and reducing reliance on goto statements.this layed the foundation for moerm programming languages and methodologies
object oriented programming 1980s-this concept allowed developwers to create modular, reusable and scalable software. it focused on real world mpodelling an dcode usability significantly improving software desihn, maintainance and development efficiency
ageile methodology 2000s- this methodologies emphasises iterative development and collaborations. it has since become the dominant approach in software development enabling faster, cheaper and customer focused development cycles

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
design: this usually involves initial outline for the overall application. theseinclude aspects like user interface,system interfaces,databases.
development: this is where the developer write the actual code and build the application using coding guidlines covered in the design.
testing: in this stage diffrent modules and designs will be intergrated into the primary code by using training or demo environments to detect errors or defects in the program

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a process that refers to a sequencial develpment process best applied to projects with clear scope and timelines.eg a construction project. Agile methodoloy is a development process that uses a flexible and iterative process where the end goal is uclear allowing development teams to quicklyy adapt to changing project requirements.eg creative projects or product inovation projects where inputs are contantly changing

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer: these are the builers of the software system their role is to write,test and maintain the code base on project specification.
quality assurance engineer: their role is to oversee the testing process of the software and to ensure i meets all quality standards outlines in the project guidlines
project manager: their role is to worl as a direct liason with the project owners do develop plans and timelines for the project, allocate resources and monitor progress. the report directlt to the project owners.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated developpment environments(ide) are essential tools that provide a comprehensive set of tools to develop efficiently.they are important because they improve code consistency and quality due to the inbuilt code formating and linting features. the also provide simple workflow beacuse you can easily navigate through code identifying errors. examples include. cisual studio code, android studio, xcode.
version control systems(vcs) are tools deployed by developers to manage source codes. they are a way of managing,organising and coordinating the develpment of objectives within the project. vcs support collaborative framework that makes it easy for developers to work together. example Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
lack of predictability in software delivery- sudden changes in project scope eg budget changes, api & third party updates can hamper efficient productivity in software development. this can be corrected is to implement robust version control systems to help in project management
scalability-code quality varies between developers so often times diffrent quality of code is deliverd. to solve this it is important to adhere to insdustry standard coding practices and have robust testing and code review policies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. Unit tests are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly by a continuous integration server.
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. For example, it can be testing the interaction with the database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. These types of tests are more expensive t
System testing, also referred to as system-level testing or system integration testing, is the process in which a quality assurance (QA) team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application., also referred to as system-level testing or system integration testing, is the process in which a quality assurance (QA) team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application.
Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. But they can also go further and measure the performance of the system and reject changes if certain goals are not met.o run as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of crafting queries or instructions in a way that helps get the best respose by defining the information you want and how you want it pesented

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Create an image of a house."

Improved Prompt:
"Create a detailed image of a cozy, two-story cottage with a red brick exterior, a thatched roof, and a small garden in front, surrounded by a white picket fence."

The improved prompt is more effective because it provides specific details about the type of house, including its size, exterior materials, and surroundings. This level of specificity helps understand exactly what is being requested, reducing ambiguity and ensuring that the final output closely matches the user's vision. A clear, specific, and concise prompt leads to better, more accurate results, minimizing the need for revisions or clarification.
